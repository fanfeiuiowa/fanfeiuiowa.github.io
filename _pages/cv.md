Education
======
* Ph.D in Industrial Engineering, University of Iowa, 2022 (expected)
* M.S. in Mechanical Engineering, University of Florida, 2016
* B.S. in Aerospace Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, 2014

Work & Research Experience
======
* 08/17 to present: Research Assistant *University of Iowa*
  * Developed a binder-free jetting-based ceramic printing process and printer.
    * Able to print complex ceramic structures with large density and strength.
    * Applications in energy devices (batteries), RF devices (antennas) and piezoelectric sensors (sonar).
  * Developed an embedded liquid metal printing process.
    * Capable of printing stretchable and low-resistance electrodes directly in silicone elastomer for underwater vehicles.
  * Developed a biomimetic self-morphing smart skin.
    * Programmable surface graphic deformation under low voltage.
    * Applications in Braille displays for blind people.
  * Developed a stereolithography-based printing process and printer for ceramics and polymer materials.
    * Application of microRNA-200c incorporated 3D-Printed bio-scaffolds enhance bone/teeth regeneration.
    * Capable of working together with deep learning algorithm for high-accuracy printing (10 µm).
  * Simulation research for the biner-free jetting-based printing process.
    * Developed a CFD model to simulate the liquid penetration behavior in powder bed under different packing density via finite element analysis (FEA) and volume of fluid (VOF) methods in ANSYS Fluid.
    * Established the numerical model to explain the dissolution-precipitation process behind the printing process via the finite element analysis (FEA) and the Level-set method in FEniCS.

* 09/19 to 12/19: Teaching Assistant *University of Iowa*
  * Course: Engineering Problem Solving-I (ENGR 1100)
  * Provided students with the opportunity to develop and demonstrate specific problem-solving skills such as using Creo for 
product design and FDM 3D printers for the fabrication, etc.

* 06/14-04/17: Research Assistant *University of Florida*
  * Simulation research for Woven Composite Materials via FEA method
    * Found the tensile strength of the WCM material unit by software of Virtual Textile Morphology Suite and Abaqus.
  * Developed a 2-DOF planar end effector with passive force control.
    * Tested the displacement and contact force of the end effector with encoders and made comparisons with the
simulation results via MATLAB Simulink.
 
* 08/13-05/14: Research Internship *Texas A&M University*
  * Design and simulation research for Mars rover’s self-folding landing structure via FEA method.
    * It is an origami structure able to fold to target shape with certain strength and unfold into flat shape for storage.
    * Simulated the folding and unfolding process of the structure by tuning the SMA’s temperature and alloy phases via 
Abaqus.
    * Optimized the structure with the objective to have lowest mass together with enough bending stiffness and buckling 
strength via OpenDAO.
