* **Printing procedure of HJF process:** It contains five steps, including powder spreading, powder packing, solution deposition, hydrothermal fusion, and de-powdering.

* **Prototype of the 2nd generation printer:** The 2nd generation HJF process is a powder-bed-based AM approach. Compared to the 1st generation, the 2nd generation printer has a piezoelectric printhead and a pressure-temperature system to do 3D printing with wider types of ceramic materials.
