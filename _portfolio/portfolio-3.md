* **Electrodes printed by embedded printing:** EGaIn is a type of conductive liquid metal material under room temperature.

* **Application - Cephalopod-inspired stretchable self-morphing skin:** The smart self-morphing skin contains EGaIn electrodes fabricated by embedded printing and artificial muscles made from polymer fibers and copper wires. The smart skin can provide on-demand texture modulation and undergo large deformation without any failure of the electrodes.

* **Test cases - flexible elastomeric glove and replica of an octopus:** The actuation of the glove under programme shows the University of Iowa’s initials, i.e., “U” and “I”. The replica of octopus highlights the feasibility of electrothermal actuation of the proposed self-morphing skin comprising liquid metal electrodes and TSAMs in an underwater environment that imitates the shape changing behavior of cephalopods.
