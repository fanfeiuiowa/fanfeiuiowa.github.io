* **Overall schematics of 1st generation HJF process**: The HJF process contains three steps, including transient solution deposition, hydrothermal pressing and ultrasound elimination. The printer of 1st generation HJF process is able to complete the task of transient solution deposition. Based on a dissolution-precipitation mechanism, the hydraulic pressing machine and the heating jacket can complete the job of hydrothermal pressing process to bond target region together without any usage of organic binder. The ultrasound machine can remove the unwanted region to form the 3D parts.

* **Design and schematics of printing process:** The 3D printer is a powder-bed-based AM approach. It completes the first step of HJF process where the transient solution is deposited into the powder bed layer by layer. The printer contains a inkjet printhead disassembled from a commeral Canon inkjet printer, a powder reservoir for powder supply, a roller for powder spread, and a building platform for inkjetting of droplets in a layerwise fashion.
