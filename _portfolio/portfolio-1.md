* **Design and schematics of printing:** The 1st generation HJF process is a powder-bed-based AM approach. The printer contains a inkjet printhead disassembled from a commeral Canon inkjet printer, a powder reservoir for powder supply, a roller for powder spread, and a building platform for inkjetting of droplets layer by layer according to the CAD design.
